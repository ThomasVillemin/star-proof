# star-model_problem
This program computes heat transfers for a simple case. It is a 3D problem where a  cube is subjected to a colimated flow on its upper side. We impose the temperature on the other faces of the cube. In a first approache, the cube is considered opaque, therefore there is only conduction in the solid. We have flow continuity on the upper side where we can couple conduction with radiative and convective transfers. First of all, we consider that the cube is surrounded by a sphere at a known temperature and there is no convective transfer (that is to say we have vacuum between the cube and the sphere). We choose the dimensions of the cube in order to see all the cases possible for the selected temperature at the end of a random path.
